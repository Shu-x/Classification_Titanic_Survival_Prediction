# Classification Titanic Survival Prediction
The famous [Kaggle machine learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This project uses classification (supervised learning) methods to predict the survivors of the Titanic. We explored:
1. Support Vector Classification (SVC)
2. Logistic Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree Classifier
6. XGBoost Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier

Best model: SVC, testing accuracy = 78%
